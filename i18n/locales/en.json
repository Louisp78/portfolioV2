From wrangling dependencies to ensuring everything ran smoothly in its new Expo-powered environment, it was like moving houses but for apps (and with fewer boxes to unpack).To top it off, I set up a sleek CI/CD pipeline with EAS, automating builds and deployments so releases now glide out effortlessly.

Along the way, I ran thorough tests with Jest and Maestro to ensure everything ran smoothly. But I didnâ€™t stop there. I built a sleek native iOS widget in Swift to help freelancers manage their availability. To top it off, I set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitLab CI to automate deployments and ensure everything runs seamlessly. All of this was done in an Agile environment, closely following the SCRUM methodology. The result? A perfectly polished and high-performing app, ready to take on the world, with smooth deployments and zero hassle for the developers. ðŸš€"

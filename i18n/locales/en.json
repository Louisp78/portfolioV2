From wrangling dependencies to ensuring everything ran smoothly in its new Expo-powered environment, it was like moving houses but for apps (and with fewer boxes to unpack).To top it off, I set up a sleek CI/CD pipeline with EAS, automating builds and deployments so releases now glide out effortlessly. The result? Two modernized apps ready to conquer the mobile world, all while keeping things snappy and stress-free for the devs. 🚀",

Along the way, I ran thorough tests with Jest and Maestro to ensure everything ran smoothly. But I didn’t stop there. I built a sleek native iOS widget in Swift to help freelancers manage their availability. To top it off, I set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitLab CI to automate deployments and ensure everything runs seamlessly. All of this was done in an Agile environment, closely following the SCRUM methodology. The result? A perfectly polished and high-performing app, ready to take on the world, with smooth deployments and zero hassle for the developers. 🚀"
